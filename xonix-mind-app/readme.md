Design and implement a game framework (field, main loop, logic of game ending).

The project uses https://projectlombok.org/. 
Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugings into editor **IntelliJ IDEA**(https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij)
and other build tools **maven**(https://projectlombok.org/setup/maven and etc), 
spicing up your java. Never write another getter or equals method again.
The java features such as **val** (Finally!Hassle-free final local variables),
or **var** (Mutably!Hassle-free local variables.) and much more.
